02-Space Shooter 

Context and date
A Space Shooter Game. 
9/23/2022

Description
In this game you can pick from 1 of 3 spaceships or 1 of 2 space turrets, and aim for the highest score by destroying enemy ships. 

## Implementation
I included features such as 5 "characters" to select from each of which has their own stats. Different kinds of enemies, one of which is a boss that spawns in 
on a timer. Sounds and Background. And a High Score leader board to save scores to your game. 

## References
Free Assets used in this game were aquired on Kenny.nl, OpenGameArt.org and ESA/Hubble.org

## Future Development
Possibly adding more characters/balancing the current list from character selection. 
More Enemies + More Bosses. 
More dynamic enemy AI/Path Finding.
